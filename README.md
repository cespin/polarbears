# Characteristics

These are the characteristics we have deemed important and why:

## Feasibility

Or the easy it is to implement the solution

###### Why?

Because Farmacy Food is very young. Its target market is still being understood and analyzed meaning that the way the company 
fulfills its mission might change too very soon.

## Scalability 

Or the ability of the system to deal with usage increments in time.

##### Why?

Because user base growth is expected and planned. The system must be able to cope with this growth.

## Availability

Or the measure at which the system is ready or available to accept and process requests.

##### Why?

If the system is not available Farmacy Food loses business. At such young age the company is not in a position to afford this.

## Reliability

Or how bulletproof the system is.

##### Why?

The system has several integrations with external actors that are necessary and key to the success of Farmacy Foods. These integrations 
need to be solid and reliable.

## Elasticity

The degree at which the system is capable of supporting sudden bursts of concurrent users.

##### Why?

Because of usage patterns like lunch time where peaks of traffic are expected. 

## Modularity

Or being made of discrete modules or parts.

##### Why?

Because the business is young. Modularization will be key after the business (and its traffic) grows. Depending on the direction
that takes optimization will be done in a per-module basis as needed.

## Usability

Or how easy-to-use the system is.

##### Why?

Because little to none user-friction is a main concern.
